## Project 1 in FYSSTK3155/4155 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Niklas Vestskogen & Eirik Holm

This project aims to study three regression methods: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge and LASSO. We will study how each of these methods manage to fit to a specific one-dimentional function, Rugne's Function, aided by various additional methods, such as gradient decent, bootstrapping and cross-validation. The performance of each model will be quantified using the mean squared error and R^2 score.
